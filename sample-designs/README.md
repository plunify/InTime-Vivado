# Sample Designs

### [Non-project mode](nonproject_mode/)

**Available in InTime 2.6.11 onwards** - Older versions of InTime only supports Tcl based flow either in project mode or via a dcp.

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to use InTime in non-project mode. To use this build script, treat it like a project file, e.g. XPR, and open it directly with InTime.

The tcl file is a typical build script. It reads in a list of files. 

```Tcl
# 
# Synthesis run script generated by Vivado
# 
read_verilog {
  alu.v
  data_mux.v
  ins_decode.v
  ins_rom.v
  io.v
  prgm_cntr.v
  reg_file.v
  spcl_regs.v
  eight_bit_uc.v
}
read_xdc eight_bit_uc.sdc
```
After that it executes the compilation steps. Note that in this case the "top" and "part" is specified
```Tcl
synth_design -top eight_bit_uc -part xc7k70tfbg484-2

write_checkpoint -force -noxdef eight_bit_uc_synth.dcp

set rc [catch {
  opt_design 
  write_checkpoint -force eight_bit_uc_opt.dcp
} RESULT]
if {$rc} {
  return -code error $RESULT
}

...
...
```
### [Project mode](project_mode/)

This example creates an XPR project.

1. The default target device is "xc7k70tfbg484-2". If you wish to target other device, please change following parameter inside the create_project.tcl:
```Tcl
# define target device
set part "xc7k70tfbg484-2"
...
```
2. Execute the create_project.tcl in the local directory:
<vivado_installation>/bin/vivado -mode batch -s create_project.tcl
Please take note the project will be created by the same Vivado version of <vivado_installation>/bin/vivado.

3. After the script is completed, a XPR project named "eight_bit_uc" will be created in local directory.

To open the project in GUI mode, run following command:
<vivado_installation>/bin/vivado -mode gui -project ./eight_bit_uc.xpr
